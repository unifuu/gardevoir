> [Juliette] What are you waiting for to marry?
>
> [Jerome] To have forgotten a great many things.
>
> [Juliette] Which you are hoping to forget soon?
>
> [Jerome] Which I do not hope ever to forget.

> [Juliette] If I understood you rightly it is to Alissa’s memory that you mean to remain faithful.
>
> [Jerome] Rather, perhaps, to her idea of me. No, don’t give me any credit for it. I think I couldn’t do otherwise. If I married another woman, I could only pretend to love her.

>
> [Jerome] Yes, Juliette.
>
> [Juliette] And that life can breathe upon it every day, without extinguishing it?
